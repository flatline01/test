# Node testing
=====

Basic node testing and learning. Nothing remotely interesting here.

01/16/18 - Lets add a router, and start setting up mvc.
01/17/18 - Should have some basic templating set up. Not sure if this is the best way. Continuing to learn more about the basics of the node system.

02/02/18 - lets add express, as that seems to already have the routing baked in. We'll use pug for view rendering, bodyParser to GET posted variables. We're going to add knex and the mysql connection.
